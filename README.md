1. Introduction
This project is a computer graphics application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a graphical interface for drawing basic geometric shapes, including lines, circles, ellipses, and Bezier curves. Additionally, the application includes functionalities for clipping and moving regions within a drawing canvas. The application is designed to assist users in visualizing and understanding fundamental computer graphics algorithms.

2. Project Structure
HTML: The structure of the webpage, which includes a sidebar for user interactions and a main content area where the drawing canvas is displayed.
CSS: Styles the user interface, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for drawing shapes, handling user inputs, and applying computer graphics algorithms.
3. HTML Structure
The HTML file is composed of two main sections:

Sidebar: Contains buttons and dropdown menus for selecting different drawing tools and algorithms.
Content Area: Includes two overlaid <canvas> elements where the drawing occurs. The lower canvas (canvas1) is used for displaying the coordinate system, and the upper canvas (canvas2) is used for drawing shapes.

4. CSS Styling
The CSS file defines the layout and appearance of the application:

Sidebar: Positioned on the left, it allows users to select different drawing options and algorithms.
Content Area: Occupies the main portion of the screen, where the canvas is centered and overlaid for drawing operations.

5. JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code handles the core functionality of the application:

Event Handling: Listens to user interactions such as button clicks and mouse events on the canvas. These events determine the selected drawing tool and the actions to be performed.
Drawing Algorithms:
Line Drawing: Implements the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) and Bresenham's algorithms for rendering lines between two points.
Circle Drawing: Uses the Midpoint Circle Algorithm to draw circles based on user-defined center and radius.
Bezier Curve: Allows the user to draw a Bezier curve by selecting control points on the canvas.
Clipping and Moving:
Clipping: Allows the user to define a rectangular clipping region. Any drawn shapes outside this region are erased.
Clipping Move: Enables users to drag and reposition the clipping region along with its contents.

6. User Interaction
The user interacts with the application via the sidebar, which includes buttons and dropdowns to select the desired tool or algorithm. Once a tool is selected, users can draw directly on the canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse.

Drawing: The user selects a shape or algorithm and then clicks on the canvas to specify the starting and ending points (or control points for curves).
Clipping: Users can define a rectangular region to clip portions of the drawing. The application also supports moving the clipping region.

7. Conclusion
This application demonstrates fundamental computer graphics algorithms through an interactive web interface. It serves as a practical tool for students and enthusiasts to experiment with and understand the basics of drawing and manipulating shapes using computer graphics techniques. The clear separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures that the application is well-structured, maintainable, and extendable for future enhancements.
